# neural_network_snake
Neural network snake game player with genetic algorithm.  
..And I think it's quite fun and meaningful to preserve it on github.

## What does it do?
It trains the neural network to play snake game which runs in the terminal.  
This is a neural network training fun stuff with genetic algorithm, my snake game and my neural network library.  
https://github.com/inu1997/csnake.git  
https://github.com/inu1997/c_neural_network.git

and mtwister library from  
https://github.com/ESultanik/mtwister.git  
(so the game with the same seed can be generated the same way everytime)

## How to play it?
1. Compile it
```
make
```
2. Run it
```
./n_snake -P -s <seed> -f <save_file>
```
or read help manual with
```
./n_snake -h
```
2.5 Stop it with Ctrl+C when you want to stop.  
..And it should generate a save file according to your argument.

3. Have fun watch your snake move.
